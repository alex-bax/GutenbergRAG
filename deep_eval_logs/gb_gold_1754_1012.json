            "R": "The score is 0.00 because none of the top-ranked nodes identify who forged Ahab\u2019s special harpoon; all four highest-ranked nodes are irrelevant. Node 1 says 'out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own' and 'Ahab knocked off the steel head,' which points to Ahab working on a harpoon rather than naming a forger. Node 2 describes 'concluding his contributory work for Ahab\u2019s leg' and 'altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons,' showing Perth\u2019s general smithing but not the pagans or Fedallah. Node 3 records 'Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?' and 'But now for the barbs; thou must make them,' implicating Perth in making barbs but not attributing the special harpoon to Fedallah. Node 4 quotes 'The harpoon,' said Ahab... 'Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,' said Stubb,' which shows the harpoon but gives no maker. Because relevant evidence naming the forger is absent and these irrelevant passages occupy the top ranks, contextual precision is zero."
