Metric: ContextualPrecisionMetric  Score: 0.5148148148148148  Threshold: 0.7
R:The score is 0.51 because the retrieval contains many clear identifications of Ahab but several irrelevant nodes are ranked too highly. For example, top-ranked node 1 states "The excerpt mentions ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ but does not name any captain" and node 2 "discusses whaling captains like ‘Captain Butler’ and hunting in general but does not mention Ahab" — these should be lower than the definitive hits. Strong relevant nodes appear at ranks 3–5 and 8–10 (node 3: "That captain was Ahab."; node 4: "That captain was Ahab... Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab’s leg,"; node 5: "wilt thou not chase the white whale?... Captain Ahab,"; node 8: "Ahab had purposely sailed ... with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale."; node 9: "“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab..."; node 10: "“Hast seen the White Whale?” ... “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously.") but irrelevant nodes like node 6 ("warns ‘the captain against attacking the White Whale’ but does not name Ahab") and node 7 ("contains no reference to Ahab") are interspersed, lowering rank-order quality. Thus the score reflects many correct hits (so it’s above chance) but imperfect ordering of irrelevant versus relevant nodes, preventing a higher score.================================

roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,

he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden

bowels to feel fear!

I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;

Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage
homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,

Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not

by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white

“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
breath.
“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”

R:The score is 0.11 because the single relevant node is far down the ranking (node 9), while many irrelevant nodes appear above it. For example, node 1 says "The passage discusses feelings before a 'Nantucket voyage' and the fate of whalemen but does not name Ishmael's ship (e.g., 'on the eve of a Nantucket voyage')." and node 2 notes "Mentions 'I, Ishmael, was one of that crew;' but does not give the ship's name or identify it as the Pequod." Node 3 similarly states "This is Ishmael's introduction ('Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...') and contains no reference to the name of the whaling ship." Node 5 adds that it only "speculates on names and does not mention the Pequod." These nodes in the top ranks should be ranked lower than the relevant node. The score is not zero because node 9 explicitly names the vessel: "They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod," which correctly identifies Ishmael's ship as the Pequod.================================

Context (10 chunks):
  [0] It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
  [1] CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous

  harpooneer is striking the whale!” —_Nantucket Song_.

  A giant in might, where might is right, And King of the boundless
  sea.” —_Whale Song_.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having

The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
  [4] thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor
have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
