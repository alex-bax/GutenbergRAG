It was one of the main\\n\\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\\n\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\\n\\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\\n\\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians.

That carries us right on to the\\n\\nother block. And now, Doctor, we\\u2019ve done our work, so it\\u2019s time we had\\n\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\n\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\n\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\n\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\n\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\n\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\n\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\n\\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\n\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\n\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\\n\\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\\n\\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\n\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\n\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\n\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\n\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\n\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\n\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\n\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\n\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\n\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\\n\\nJames\\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\n\\nhe had set himself to hunt
