Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\\n\\nseen\\u2014Moby Dick\\u2014Moby Dick!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab,\\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\\n\\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\\n\\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \\u201cCaptain\\n\\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dick\\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off\\n\\nthy leg?\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWho told thee that?\\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \\u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my\\n\\nhearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that\\n\\nbrought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\\u201d he shouted\\n\\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor\\n\\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\\u201d Then tossing both arms, with\\n\\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: \\u201cAye, aye! and I\\u2019ll chase him\\n\\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\\n\\nand round perdition\\u2019s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\\n\\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\\n\\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\\n\\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\\n\\nlook brave.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye!\\u201d shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\\n\\nexcited old man: \\u201cA sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\\n\\nMoby Dick!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cGod bless ye,\\u201d he seemed to half sob and half shout. \\u201cGod bless ye,\\n\\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what\\u2019s this long\\n\\nface about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\\n\\ngame for Moby Dick?\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\\n\\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\\n\\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commander\\u2019s vengeance. How many\\n\\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\\n\\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cNantucket market! Hoot! \", \"Surmises.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\n\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\\n\\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\\n\\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\\n\\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman\\u2019s ways, altogether\\n\\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\\n\\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\\n\\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\\n\\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\n\\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\\n\\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\\n\\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\\n\\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\\n\\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\\n\\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\\n\\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\\n\\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\\n\\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\\n\\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\\n\\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\\n\\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\\n\\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck\\u2019s body and Starbuck\\u2019s coerced\\n\\nwill were Ahab\\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\\u2019s brain;\\n\\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\\n\\nhis captain\\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\\n\\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\\n\\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\\n\\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\n\\ncaptain\\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\\n\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\\n\\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\\n\\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\\n\\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\\n\\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\\n\\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\\n\\nbackground (for few men\\u2019s courage is proof against protracted\\n\\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\\n\\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\\n\\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\\n\\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\\n\\nmore or less capricious and unreliable\\u2014they live in the varying outer\\n\\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness\\u2014and when retained for any\\n\\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\\n\\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\\n\\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\\n\\nsuspended for the final dash.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\\n\\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\\n\\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\\n\\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\\n\\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\\n\\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\\n\\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\\n\\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\\n\\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\\n\\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\\n\\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\\n\\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\\n\\nand romantic object\\u2014that final and romantic object, too many would have\\n\\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\\n\\nall hopes of cash\\u2014aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\\n\\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\\n\\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\\n\\nsoon cashier Ahab.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\\n\\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\\n\\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\\n\\nPequod\\u2019s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\\n\\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\\n\\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\\n\\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\\n\\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\\n\\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\\n\\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\\n\\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\\n\\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\\n\\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\\n\\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\\n\\nsubjected to.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\\n\\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\\n\\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\\u2019s\\n\\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\\n\\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\\n\\npursuit of his profession.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\n\\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\\n\\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"come down!\\u2014Mr. Stubb, send\\n\\na fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\\n\\nmorning.\\u201d\\u2014Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast\\u2014\\u201cMen,\\n\\nthis gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\\n\\nthe White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\\n\\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man\\u2019s; and if on\\n\\nthat day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\\n\\ndivided among all of ye! Away now!\\u2014the deck is thine, sir!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\\n\\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\\n\\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 134. The Chase\\u2014Second Day.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cD\\u2019ye see him?\\u201d cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light\\n\\nto spread.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cSee nothing, sir.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cTurn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\\n\\nfor;\\u2014the top-gallant sails!\\u2014aye, they should have been kept on her all\\n\\nnight. But no matter\\u2014\\u2019tis but resting for the rush.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\\n\\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is\\n\\na thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is\\n\\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\\n\\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\\n\\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\\n\\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\\n\\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\\n\\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\\n\\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\\n\\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\\n\\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\\n\\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\\n\\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\\n\\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\\n\\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\\n\\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\\n\\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature\\u2019s future\\n\\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\\n\\nmind of the hunter, as the pilot\\u2019s coast is to him. So that to this\\n\\nhunter\\u2019s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\\n\\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\\n\\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\\n\\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\\n\\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby\\u2019s pulse; and lightly\\n\\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\\n\\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\\n\\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\\n\\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\\n\\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\\n\\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\\n\\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\\n\\nsea must be the whaleman\\u2019s allies; for of what present avail to the\\n\\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\\n\\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\\n\\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\\n\\nchase of whales.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\n\\ncannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\\n\\nfield.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cBy salt and hemp!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cbut this swift motion of the deck\\n\\ncreeps up one\\u2019s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two\\n\\nbrave fellows!\\u2014Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\\n\\non the sea,\\u2014for by live-oaks! my spine\\u2019s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\\n\\nthat leaves no dust behind!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cThere she blows\\u2014she blows!\\u2014she blows!\\u2014right ahead!\\u201d was now the\\n\\nmast-head cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cI knew it\\u2014ye can\\u2019t escape\\u2014blow on and split\\n\\nyour spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your\\n\\ntrump\\u2014blister your lungs!\\u2014Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller\\n\\nshuts his watergate upon the stream!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\\n\\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\\n\\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\\n\\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\\n\\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\\n\\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\\n\\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\\n\\nprevious day; the rack of the past night\\u2019s suspense; the fixed,\\n\\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\\n\\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\\n\\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\\n\\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\\n\\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\\n\\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things\\u2014oak, and maple,\\n\\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\\u2014yet all these ran into each\\n\\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\\n\\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\\n\\nof the crew, this man\\u2019s valor, that man\\u2019s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\\n\\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\\n\\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\n\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\\n\\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\\n\\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\\n\\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\\n\\ntheir fate. Ah! \", \"question that\\n\\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\\n\\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\\n\\nState-secret come.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\\n\\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\\n\\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\\n\\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\\n\\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\\n\\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\\n\\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\\n\\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\\n\\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\n\\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\\n\\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\\n\\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\\n\\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\\n\\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\\n\\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\\n\\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\\n\\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\\n\\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\\n\\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\\n\\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\\n\\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\\n\\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\\n\\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\\n\\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\n\\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\\n\\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\\n\\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\\n\\nin him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\\n\\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\\n\\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\\n\\nmint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\\n\\nrevenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses\\n\\na Job\\u2019s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made\\n\\nup of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals\\u2014morally enfeebled\\n\\nalso, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\\n\\nStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\\n\\nStubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so\\n\\nofficered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\\n\\nto help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\\n\\naboundingly responded to the old man\\u2019s ire\\u2014by what evil magic their\\n\\nsouls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\\n\\nWhite Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to\\n\\nbe\\u2014what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\\n\\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\\n\\nseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,\\u2014all this to\\n\\nexplain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go.

In other studies you go as far as\\n\\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\\n\\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\\n\\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\\n\\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\\n\\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\\n\\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\\n\\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\\n\\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\\n\\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\\n\\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\\n\\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\\n\\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\\n\\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\n\\nhappened that protracted my stay.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\\n\\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\\n\\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\\n\\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\\n\\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\\n\\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\\n\\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\\n\\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\\n\\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\\n\\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\\n\\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\\n\\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\\n\\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\\n\\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\\n\\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\\n\\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\\n\\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\\n\\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\\n\\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\\n\\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\\n\\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\\n\\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\\n\\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\\n\\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\\n\\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\\n\\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\\n\\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\\n\\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\\n\\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\\n\\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me\\u2014a light so brilliant and\\n\\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\\n\\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\\n\\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\\n\\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\\n\\nsecret.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\\n\\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\\n\\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\\n\\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\\n\\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\\n\\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\\n\\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\\n\\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\\n\\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\\n\\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\\n\\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\\n\\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\\n\\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\\n\\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\\n\\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\\n\\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\\n\\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\\n\\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\\n\\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\\n\\nineffectual light.\\n\\n\\n\\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\\n\\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\\n\\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\\n\\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\\n\\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\\n\\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\\n\\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\\n\\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\\n\\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\\n\\nwill allow.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\\n\\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\\n\\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\\n\\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\\n\\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\\n\\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\\n\\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\\n\\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\\n\\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\\n\\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\\n\\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\\n\\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\\n\\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\\n\\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\\n\\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\\n\\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\\n\\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\\n\\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\\n\\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\\n\\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\\n\\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\\n\\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\\n\\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\\n\\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\\n\\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\\n\\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\\n\\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\\n\\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\\n\\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\\n\\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\\n\\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\\n\\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\\n\\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\\n\\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\\n\\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\\n\\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\\n\\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\\n\\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\\n\\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\\n\\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\\n\\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\\n\\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\\n\\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\\n\\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\\n\\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\\n\\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\\n\\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\\n\\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\\n\\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\\n\\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\\n\\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\\n\\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\\n\\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\\n\\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\\n\\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\\n\\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\\n\\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\\n\\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\\n\\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\\n\\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\\n\\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\\n\\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\\n\\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\\n\\nwell remembered the words of my father: \\u201cI know that while you are\\n\\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\\n\\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\\n\\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\\n\\nare equally neglected.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew well therefore what would be my father\\u2019s feelings, but I could\\n\\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\\n\\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\\n\\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\\n\\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\\n\\nshould be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\\n\\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\\n\\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\\n\\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\\n\\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\\n\\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\\n\\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\\n\\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\\n\\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\\n\\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\\n\\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\\n\\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\\n\\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, C\\u00e6sar would have spared his\\n\\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\\n\\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\\n\\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\\n\\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\\n\\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\\n\\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves\\u2014sights which before always\\n\\nyielded me supreme delight\\u2014so deeply was I engrossed in my\\n\\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\\n\\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\\n\\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\\n\\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\\n\\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\\n\\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\\n\\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\\n\\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\\n\\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\\n\\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\\n\\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\\n\\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\\n\\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\\n\\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\\n\\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\\n\\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\n\\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\n\\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\n\\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\n\\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\n\\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\n\\nbeautiful. \", \"She moved again, and I fled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cFor some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\\n\\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\\n\\nits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\\n\\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\\n\\npassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\\n\\npromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\\n\\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\\n\\nwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\\n\\nand have the same defects. This being you must create.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\\n\\nexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\\n\\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\\n\\nproposition. He continued,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cYou must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\\n\\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone\\n\\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\\n\\nconcede.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\\n\\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\\n\\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\\n\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI do refuse it,\\u201d I replied; \\u201cand no torture shall ever extort a\\n\\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\\n\\nshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\\n\\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. \", \"\\u201cIt is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\\n\\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\\n\\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\\n\\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\\n\\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\\n\\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\\n\\nfrom your power.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cOh, it is not thus\\u2014not thus,\\u201d interrupted the being.\\n\\n\\u201cYet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\\n\\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\\n\\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\\n\\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\\n\\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\\n\\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\\n\\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\\n\\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\\n\\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\\n\\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\\n\\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\\n\\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\\n\\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\\n\\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\\n\\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\\n\\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\\n\\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\\n\\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\\n\\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\\n\\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cYou, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\\n\\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\\n\\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\\n\\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\\n\\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\\n\\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\\n\\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\\n\\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\\n\\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\\n\\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\\n\\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\\n\\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\\n\\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cBut it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\\n\\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\\n\\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\\n\\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\\n\\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\\n\\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\\n\\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\\n\\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\\n\\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\\n\\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cFear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\\n\\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man\\u2019s death is needed to\\n\\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\\n\\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\\n\\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\\n\\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\\n\\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\\n\\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\\n\\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "Great job\u2014no irrelevant content detected, so the output is perfectly relevant to the question.

Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\n\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\n\\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\\n\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\\n\\nhouse in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\\n\\nof the red-headed copier of the _Encyclop\\u00e6dia_ down to the visit to\\n\\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\\n\\nme. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\n\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\n\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\\u2014a\\n\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\n\\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\n\\nexplanation.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\n\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\n\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\\n\\nthe sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\\n\\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\\n\\nJones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\\n\\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\n\\nfrock-coat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cHa! Our party is complete,\\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\n\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \\u201cWatson, I think you\\n\\nknow Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\n\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\u2019s adventure.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\\u201d said Jones in his\\n\\nconsequential way. \\u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\n\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\\u201d\\n\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"I remember nothing until I\\n\\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\n\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\\n\\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\\n\\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\n\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\\n\\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\\n\\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\\n\\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\n\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\\n\\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\\n\\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\\n\\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\\n\\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\\n\\nfree. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\\n\\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\\n\\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\\u2019clock,\\n\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\\n\\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\n\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\\n\\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\\n\\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\\n\\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cYes. \", \"She is waiting now in\\n\\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at\\n\\nthis hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,\\n\\nI presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\n\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\n\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\\n\\nshould call you and give you the chance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\n\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\\n\\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he\\n\\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\\n\\nmy clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\\n\\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\\n\\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cGood-morning, madam,\\u201d said Holmes cheerily. \\u201cMy name is Sherlock\\n\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\n\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! \", \"Well, he has always answered me like\\n\\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am\\n\\nmyself. And now\\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\\n\\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\\n\\nGod help me!\\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\n\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\\n\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the\\n\\ntable. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cGet out!\\u201d said he.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cNo more words. Get out!\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\n\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\\n\\nfrom the street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cAfter all, Watson,\\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\n\\npipe, \\u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\n\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\n\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\\n\\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\n\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\n\\nSend him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,\\n\\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\\n\\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If\\n\\nyou will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\\n\\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\\n\\nfeature.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\\n\\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\\n\\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\\n\\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\\n\\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\\n\\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\\n\\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\\n\\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\\n\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\n\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\n\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is\\n\\npossible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\\n\\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\\n\\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\\n\\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\\n\\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread\\n\\nrumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\\n\\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was early in April in the year \\u201983 that I woke one morning to find\\n\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\\n\\na late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me\\n\\nthat it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some\\n\\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\\n\\nregular in my habits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\\u201d said he, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s the common lot\\n\\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\\n\\nand I on you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it, then\\u2014a fire?\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\n\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "There are no irrelevant statements, so the relevancy is already perfect (1.0); the question has a direct answer (Dr. John Watson), and nothing extraneous was included\u2014great focus and keep it up.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "Azure OpenAI (gpt-5-nano)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"Holmes\u2019s friend and the usual narrator is Dr. Watson.\"\n] \n \nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": \"\"\n    }\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.7, "evaluation_model": "Azure OpenAI (gpt-5-nano)", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}, {"metric_data": {"name": "Faithfulness", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the contradiction list is empty, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context.
